## Intro

```jsx
const state = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot[, getServerSnapshot]);
```

useSyncExternalStore is a hook recommended for reading and subscribing from external data sources in a way thatâ€™s compatible with concurrent rendering features like selective hydration and time slicing.

The goal is to avoid tearing. See https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/69

This method returns the value of the store and accepts three arguments:

- `subscribe`: function to register a callback that is called whenever the store changes.
- `getSnapshot`: function that returns the current value of the store.
  getServerSnapshot: function that returns the snapshot used during server rendering.

## Additional details

- selectedFields
- SSR

- interesting that suscribe doesn't need to return anything. getSnapshot is called!

## Shims to Support older React Versions

- use-sync-external-store/shim
- use-sync-external-store/with-selector

## Exercise: refactor the useYScroll to use useSyncExternalStore

## Bonus Exercise: Use our own custom Store

## Bonus Exercise: extend the store to have selected fields
